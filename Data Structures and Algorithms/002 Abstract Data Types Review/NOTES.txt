What are data types?

	- A set of values and the set of operations you can run on those values.
	
	- We have int, double, float, long, short. We can assign numbers to these data types
	  and then perform operations with them (e.g. add, subtract, etc.). These are called
	  "primitive data types" because they are predefined by the Java language as reserved
	  terms. They are building blocks of the language.
	  
	  
What are abstract data types (ADT)?

	- Data types that can handle far more advanced functionalities.
	
	- Created using classes. We can create instances of an ADT and store data in them.
	
	- Recall Animal class, creating instances of that Animal class and assigning it its own
	  data as well as invoking the class's methods.
	  
	- An ADT's representation is meant to be hidden from the client that uses it.
	

	
CHALLENGE: 
	
	Create an ADT called COUNTER which will maintain numeric data. It will be used to keep 
	track of the current number being advanced. Clients can use this ADT without having to 
	worry about how it works.
